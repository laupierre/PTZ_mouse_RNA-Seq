Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), a GABA receptor antagonist, is used to create a common chemically- induced seizure model. Amongst all animal models of seizure and epilepsy, the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures are categorized as a model of generalized seizure (versus partial or focal seizure). It produces a myoclonic seizure that models absence (petit mal) seizures.
